Example: Android Simple w/AOSP build
=======================

This is a implementation of [android-simple](https://github.com/google/dagger/tree/master/examples/android-simple) 
using the Android Open Source build system.

This is meant for AOSP developers wishing to use Dagger in their OEM/System applications/ROM applications.

## PLEASE NOTE
Please note that I have not done extended testing on this. I made it work, tested it on one phone, and commited it. *This is a proof of concept.*
